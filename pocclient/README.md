Proof of Concept -Client
========================

Used to test the scaling and fuzzing functions, basic idea is that the waypoints are known (and visibility toggleable)
Clicking on the map will set your "current position" there and then clicking on a "ping" button will do a ping, the result
is immediately visualized on the map as circles (ponder: use line thickness to indicate the uncertainty [since here we know it] ?)
